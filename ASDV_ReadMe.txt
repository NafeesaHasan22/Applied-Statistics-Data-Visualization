Features:
1. Interactive visuals for time-series trends and annual snapshots.
2. Comparison of economic indicators across countries and regions.
3. Customizable views to facilitate in-depth analysis.

Fields Included:
1. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor.pbix - The Power BI file containing the dashboard. 
2. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor.pdf - A comprehensive report detailing the dashboard's design, methodology, and critical evaluation.

Software/Tools Used:
Power BI for data visualisation.

Instructions for Use:
1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the dashboard by interacting with filters, slicers, and visualisations. 
3. Refer to the accompanying report for insights into the methodology and findings.

Task 2:
Optimizing Concrete Mix Designs: Predicting Compressive Strengths Through Data-Driven Analysis

Purpose:
This task focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition using regression techniques in R Studio. The goal is to optimize concrete mix designs for cost-efficiency and sustainability while meeting specific structural requirements. 

Features:
1. Predictive models built using multiple regression techniques.
2. Analysis of the impact of mix components (cement, water, aggregates, additives) on compressive strength.
3. Recommendations for mix optimization based on model findings.

Fields Included:
1. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor_Task 2.R - R Script file containing the code for data analysis and modelling.
2. concrete compressive strength.xlsx - Dataset used for the analysis.
3. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor.pdf - Detailed report on the research, methodology, results, and optimization recommendations. 

Software/Tools Used:
R Studio for data analysis and regression modelling.

Instructions for Use:
1. Open the .R script in R Studio.
2. Load the concrete compressive strength.xlsx file as specified in the script.
3. Run the script to reproduce the analysis and generate results.

Task 3:
Forecasting Share Price Trends for Addex Therapeutics Ltd (ADS): Time Series Modelling of Closing Prices

Purpose:
This task aims to forecast the closing prices of Addex Therapeutics Ltd shares using time series analysis in R Studio. The study uses historical financial data to build a predictive model, aiding investment decisions by analysing price trends and patterns.

Features:
1. Time series modelling using historical closing prices.
2. Forecasting future share price trends to enhance investment strategies.
3. Insights into price volatility and investor sentiment.

Fields Included:
1. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor_Task 3.R - R Script file containing the code for time series modelling.
2. ADXN.csv - Dataset used for the analysis.
3. Nafeesa Hasan Shaik Khaja Nagoor.pdf - A report discussing the research question, methodology, model performance, and investment implications.
